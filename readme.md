This is a Trivia Game referenced from Harry Sadler of CodePen.

I chose to create this as my Project 1 which we were required to build something using HTML CSS and javascript.

This simple trivia is designed to be a game of questions within the catagory of Video Games.

The app can successfully render in a browser like "Chrome" and utilizes DOM Manipulation.

I plan to update this in the future to incorporate more functionality such as a timer, the ability to choose teams and more questions. I am also interested in allowing the game to make AJAX calls to a web API and pull questions from the Web.
